## Features

-   XBar will auto create a button frame according your icon, you just only need to write a frame to load.
-   Also work with [XBar Addon Management](http://www.curse.com/addons/rom/sample-xbar-addon-management/).
-   Show any status which you want, add Tooltip and click function.

  
XBar Buttons support is still under build.  
Thanks suggests of McBen and Peryl.
